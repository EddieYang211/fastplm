# FastPLM

A package for fast fixed-effects algorithms.

## Package Structures

The package is structurally similar to most packages using Rcpp, with `src` directories containing all C/C++ codes. However, we also provide `cmake` support, with which we can build and debug a pure C++ package using whatever tool chains convenient.
