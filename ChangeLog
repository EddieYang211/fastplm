  Handle group indicators of type "character" for "predictFE".

  The bug is the same as the one fixed in commit 628681518ecb8aacabbfc8c24a8a3db4035f7473
  (https://github.com/xuyiqing/fastplm/commit/628681518ecb8aacabbfc8c24a8a3db4035f7473).
  This time it occurs in "predictFE".

  modified:   R/Wrapper.R

  Add unit test for predicting fixed effects. We compare the predicted results
  using the same X used for "solveFE" with fitted values given by the latter.
  The following two situations are checked:

  * group indicators ranging from 1 consecutively to N
  * some random character-based indicators

  new file:   tests/testthat/test-predict-fixed-effects.R

  Functions from
    tests/testthat/test-demean-fixed-effects.R
  are abstracted into
    tests/testthat/make-small-data.R
  for reusing. Also, group values are renamed as group indicators for consistency.

  Handle group indicators of type "character".

  In "R/Wrapper.R", f the input group indicators are of type "character", 
  the factor-ed indicators will also be coerced into "character".
  This change assign each column of the factor-ed indicators into a new
  variable to avoid the "coercion pollution".

  modified:   R/Wrapper.R

  Add unit test for demeaning fixed effects. We compare

  * the coefficients given by "solveFE" and "felm"
  * two outputs by "solveFE" supplied with
    * group indicators ranging from 1 consecutively to N
    * some random character-based indicators

  Employ "testthat" for unit tests.
