  Handle group indicators of type "character".

  In "R/Wrapper.R", f the input group indicators are of type "character", 
  the factor-ed indicators will also be coerced into "character".
  This change assign each column of the factor-ed indicators into a new
  variable to avoid the "coercion pollution".

  modified:   R/Wrapper.R

  Add unit test for demeaning fixed effects. We compare

  * the coefficients given by "solveFE" and "felm"
  * two outputs by "solveFE" supplied with
    * a group indicators ranging from 1 consecutively to N
    * some random character-based indicators
