  Bump the version number to 0.1.5.3 to reflect recent bug fixes.

  Note that previously 0.1.5.2 was released but the git commits are not pushed
  to the repository so it stayed 0.1.5.1. This change is to avoid conflict when
  installing this package.

  E-mail address for Minsheng Liu is also updated.

  Handle group indicators of type "character" for "predictFE".

  The bug is the same as the one fixed in commit 628681518ecb8aacabbfc8c24a8a3db4035f7473
  (https://github.com/xuyiqing/fastplm/commit/628681518ecb8aacabbfc8c24a8a3db4035f7473).
  This time it occurs in "predictFE".

  modified:   R/Wrapper.R

  Add unit test for predicting fixed effects. We compare the predicted results
  using the same X used for "solveFE" with fitted values given by the latter.
  The following two situations are checked:

  * group indicators ranging from 1 consecutively to N
  * some random character-based indicators

  new file:   tests/testthat/test-predict-fixed-effects.R

  Functions from
    tests/testthat/test-demean-fixed-effects.R
  are abstracted into
    tests/testthat/make-small-data.R
  for reusing. Also, group values are renamed as group indicators for consistency.

  Handle group indicators of type "character".

  In "R/Wrapper.R", f the input group indicators are of type "character", 
  the factor-ed indicators will also be coerced into "character".
  This change assign each column of the factor-ed indicators into a new
  variable to avoid the "coercion pollution".

  modified:   R/Wrapper.R

  Add unit test for demeaning fixed effects. We compare

  * the coefficients given by "solveFE" and "felm"
  * two outputs by "solveFE" supplied with
    * group indicators ranging from 1 consecutively to N
    * some random character-based indicators

  Employ "testthat" for unit tests.
